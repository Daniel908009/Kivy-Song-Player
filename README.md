## To do
[X] file and directory loading <br>
[X] menu with rewind, forward, next, previous, and stop buttons<br>
[X] scroll menu with all the songs listed<br>
[] better UI (more colours and a song progress bar)<br>
[] cleaner code (there is currently a lot of code that repeats everywhere, so I will need to add functions to clear it out)<br>
[] more functionalities (repeat list in a loop and similar features)<br>
[] fixing all possible errors (currently you can rewind, even though there are no songs, will fix soon)<br>
